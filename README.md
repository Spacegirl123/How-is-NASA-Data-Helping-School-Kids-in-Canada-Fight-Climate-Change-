Participate in Tree Density Monitoring of Schools and Local Parks


Step 1 (Software): Go to https://canopy.itreetools.org/ and click “Get Started” at top right. 


 

Step 2: (Zoom to your school): Search your school or local park on the map using the address. 

 
Step 3: (Mark Boundaries): Click “Draw Boundary” at the top right. Mark all the corners of your school or local park. Click on the first corner again and click next.

Step 4: (Mark the Trees): Click “Tree/Non-Tree” button at the top. Click next, ignore the text, and click next again.  
Click “Plus” button near the bottom. A Yellow Cross will appear on your school map. 
If the Cross falls on tree area select tree. If it falls on non-tree area select non-tree.  Click “Save & Create New”.
Repeat the process at least 100 times. More you sample, more accurate the results will be.

Step 5: (Get the Results): Click on the blue “Report” button once you have finished.
You will see a graph. Below the graph you will see a table with some values. Go to the “points” part of the table and look at the second value on the screen. That is the tree density of your school.

  
step 6: go to https://snack.ushahidi.io/views/map. Click the Plus botton on the top left of your screen. Fill in the name of your school, the tree density of your school, its location on a map, and a photo of your school(optional). When you are done click the submit botton on the top right of your screen.

You are done! Results of tree density of your school or local parks will be published on the CrowdMap: https://snack.ushahidi.io/views/map
